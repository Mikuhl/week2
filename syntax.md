1. My answer is that it would not be seen as a valid HTML syntax. I think the  Will I be seen? paragraph is missing a <p></p> tag.
 It needs a tag used to display and format text. It will be seen in a browser since in class we learn that HTML is pretty basic 
as far as showing in a browser. It may not show correctly though. Also in the beginning, it does not show the stadard <!DOCTYPE html>.
