  		<article><p>Known for their loose-jointed, shuffling gait and massive, short-faced head, the Bulldog is known to be equable, resolute and dignified. A medium-sized dog, they are not your typical lap dog, but would like to be! They are one of the most popular breeds according to AKCÂ® Registration Statistics due to their lovable and gentle dispositions and adorable wrinkles. <b>The Bulldog</b> may be brindle, white, red, fawn, fallow or piebald.</p>

	<p>My bully <b>Rickson</b> is my first dog. I got him when I turned 40-years old. I know it was kind of late in life but better late than never. He is 4 1/2 years old and weighs 64-lbs and short and stocky. He is my buddy and sidekick.
	Sometimes called the English Bulldog or the British Bulldog, the breed originated in England and has a bloody past. It descended from fighting mastiffs that were brought to the British Isles by the Romans and was used in a bloody sport called bullbaiting. Today, however, the Bulldog only slightly resembles his ancestors in appearance. And all of the ferociousness that he exhibited in the bullbaiting pens? Gone for good. Despite his still ferocious appearance, you'd be hard-pressed to find a dog with a sweeter, more loving disposition.</p>
